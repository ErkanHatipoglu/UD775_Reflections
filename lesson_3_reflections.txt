When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with a group of people in the same project a remote repository
    will be a better idea since everybody in the group will contribute to the 
    project independantly/at the same time/from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    May be another contributer have committed some changes which I do not
    want.

    In addition as stated in "Keeping Repositories in Sync" section if my 
    local repository stays automatically up-to-date with my remote repository
    new features which are not ready will be commited to remote repository and
    this may be confusing for other contributers. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is copying a repository to local computer while fork is copying
    a GitHub repository to another GitHub repository. Branch is a new commit
    route on a GitHub or local repository which is different from the main
    commit route (mater).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    By copying the last known state of the remote and using git log and git
    diff can be used to see the changes on local and remote while you are 
    offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would probably send email and/or call the other collaborator/s
    I think it will be harder for the other collaborator/s to understand my
    changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
